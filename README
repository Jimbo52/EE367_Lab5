To compile net367:
make net367

To run program:
net367 (cshell)
or
./net367 (bash)

Upon startup, the program will prompt the user for a file from which to read
the topology of the network.  Type in the file name (e.g. startopology.dat or
treetopology.dat).  The program will reiterate the information from the file
to ensure that the desired information is being used.

From there, the program will turn to the system manager, where normal
operation is taken.

Creating a topology:
The accepted format for the topology file is as follows:

Number of hosts:
#
Number of switchs:
#
Number of links:
#
Link endpoints (i,j):
(i,j)
...
(k,l)

where the #'s are integers representing the number of hosts, switchs, and
links, as appropriate, and i,j,k,l represent nodes (either switchs or hosts).
Hosts are labeled from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of hosts.  Switchs are
labeled n to n+m-1, where m is the number of switchs.
