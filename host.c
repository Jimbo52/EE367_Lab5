/*  620 670
 * hostMain is the main function for the host.  It is an infinite
 * loop that repeatedy polls the connection from the manager and
 * its input link.  
 *
 * If there is command message from the manager,
 * it parses the message and executes the command.  Then it
 * will send a reply back to the manager.  
 *
 * If there is a packet on its incoming link, it checks if
 * the packet is destined for it.  Then it stores the packet
 * in its receive packet buffer.
 *
 * There is also a 10 millisecond delay in the loop caused by
 * the system call "usleep".  This puts the host to sleep for a
 * fixed amount of time.  This should keep the all the nodes
 * in the network working at the same rate; all nodes will do
 * some tasks then sleep for a fixed amount of time, then do
 * additional tasks then sleep for a fixed amount of time.  
 * This help ensure that no node does too much work compared
 * to the others.  Thus, the nodes all work at the same rate.
 * This prevents some nodes working too fast for the other
 * nodes to keep up.
